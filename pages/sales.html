                    <h2>Sales and Promotion Policy for Paradigma Games</h2>
                    <p>Creating and presenting our products involves considerable effort, making promotions and discounts a rare occurrence. Our discount codes are exclusively valid for orders under the same account and are non-transferable.</p>
                    <p>Please note that promotions and discount codes are applicable only to in-stock items, and rain-checks are regrettably unavailable. To fully benefit from our promotions and discounts, ensure they are utilized within the designated sale window, as retroactive use is not permitted. Unfortunately, due to factors such as financial and tax records, we cannot provide partial refunds for orders placed outside the sale window.</p>
                    <p>We do not engage in price matching for any special sale prices or promotions. It's important to note that all items marked as sale items are considered final sale, and we encourage customers to carefully review their selections before completing their purchase.</p>
